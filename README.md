# Install Portworx through Ansible

Portworx is typically deployed through/with the container orchestrator.
For Kubernetes, Portworx is deployed as a `daemonset` through the 
[Portworx installer](https://install.portworx.com/)
For DCOS, Portworx is deployed through [Universe](https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/mesosphere-dcos/install.html)

This `ansible` script is intended to help install Portworx
for [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)
or for other environments where Portworx is to be deployed directly.
